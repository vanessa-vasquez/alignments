# <p align="center"> alignments </p>

This is a simple web app allowing you to create and share alignment charts. This project was built using React, Material UI, and Firebase.

## Setup

1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
2. Since this project uses Firebase, you will need to add your Firebase credentials to a .env file. Make sure to add your .env file to your .gitignore file as well.
3. Once you have set up Firebase with your own credentials, ru a local development server: `npm start`.
